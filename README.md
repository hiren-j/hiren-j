Hey! I’m Hiren Joshi, an avid competitive programmer rated 1700 on LeetCode, In Top 12% and solved 1100+ problems on it. I’ve been programming in C++ for the past 2 years, and my key ability is to create fast programs while maintaining clean code so that it becomes easy to read and understand. I love problem-solving and have a solid grasp of Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA & ADSA).

My typing speed ranges over 75-90 WPM, I can communicate fluently in English, and I’m a quick learner. I also love to teach, especially when it comes to DSA. Right now, I’m learning Full Stack Development (MERN stack) and have a strong grasp of core CS subjects like Operating Systems, OOPS, CN, DBMS, and System Design, while I'm continuously learning to reach more better level.
